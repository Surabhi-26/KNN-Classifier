# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier for Iris Flower Dataset

This repository contains the implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for classifying the Iris flower dataset. KNN is a simple and intuitive machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks.

## Introduction

The Iris flower dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The task is to classify each iris flower into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

## Implementation

The KNN classifier implemented in this repository is written in Python using the scikit-learn library. It follows these basic steps:

1. **Loading the Dataset:** The Iris dataset is loaded from the scikit-learn library.
2. **Preprocessing:** No preprocessing is required for this dataset.
3. **Training the Classifier:** The KNN classifier is trained on the training data.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The performance of the classifier is evaluated using cross-validation or a separate test dataset.
5. **Prediction:** Given a new set of features, the trained classifier predicts the class label of the input.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib (for visualization)
